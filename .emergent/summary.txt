The AI engineer's work primarily focused on iteratively enhancing an NFL fantasy football application. Key tasks included a significant UI overhaul, moving filters from a horizontal top layout to a resizable, collapsible vertical left sidebar. A data quality issue concerning ambiguous LA team codes in game data was identified and partially addressed. The Analytics tab was transformed into a Trend Tool, evolving through multiple stages: from a basic week-by-week player trend display to a highly granular, aesthetically refined, and ultimately an exact UI replication of a user-provided design. Crucially, the broken RapidAPI integration for DraftKings pricing was replaced by successfully integrating data from a Google Sheet. Throughout the process, the engineer demonstrated strong debugging skills, adapting to detailed user feedback on layout, styling, data representation, and conditional formatting, culminating in a feature-rich and visually precise application. The work concluded amidst further refinements to the Trend Tool's game separation, space-saving UI, and collapsible columns.

<product_requirements>
The application's core requirement was a dense AG-grid for NFL player statistics, supporting 2024/2025 data and DraftKings PPR scoring. Initial UI requirements included specific column headers, reduced padding, auto-resized columns, and row shading. Subsequent requests involved moving snap counts to nominal values, DraftKings pricing as numerical salaries, color-coded statistics, PPR/Half-PPR toggles, a right-sliding resizable player detail panel, removal of filter triangles/checkboxes, professional styling, a resizable left sidebar, logo replacement, and clear 3-letter column abbreviations. The app transitioned to a tabbed layout with a top-collapsible filter section and specific formatting for game results. DraftKings pricing for 2024 should not be shown, only 2025. The Analytics tab was renamed Trend Tool, requiring a condensed, week-to-week player trend view, evolving into a highly granular, aesthetically refined UI with specific position grouping, game results, resizable columns, persistent settings, and an exact UI replication of a provided screenshot, focusing on space efficiency and modern aesthetics, including collapsible column options.

    -   **Summary**: The core FastAPI backend. Handles data, DuckDB, , Polars.
    -   **Changes**: Initially processes  data, including snap counts. Key changes include adding  function to ingest DraftKings pricing data from Google Sheets into the  table, and exposing it via  endpoint. It also processes player weekly statistics which feeds into both the main data table and the Trend Tool.

    -   **Summary**: Main React component managing UI, AG Grid, filters, and player details.
    -   **Changes**: Extensive modifications. Filters were moved from a horizontal top layout to a vertical, resizable, collapsible left sidebar. The Analytics tab was renamed to Trend Tool and underwent multiple rebuilds: initially a condensed week-by-week view, then a granular display with all stats per week, refined with softer aesthetics, win/loss indicators, resizable/persistent columns, and ultimately an exact UI replication from a screenshot, including position-based color coding, sticky columns, and a three-tier header system. Game data display was fixed from mock values to actual opponent matchups (e.g., DAL vs GB), and DraftKings pricing integrated from the backend. Conditional formatting for Fantasy Points (FPTS) was implemented and refined with subtle colors. State for collapsible columns was introduced.

    -   **Summary**: Styling using Tailwind CSS.
    -   **Changes**: Modified to support the new left sidebar layout, grouped column headers in the main data table (color-coded), and the various aesthetic refinements for the Trend Tool, including softer shading, win/loss indicators, and specific background colors for position groups and FPTS.

<pending_tasks>
- Refine the Trend Tool user interface to implement:
    - Better game separation, clearly showing what each player did one game versus the other.
    - An efficient way to break up the games in the UI.
    - An option to collapse certain columns for each week.
    - Completing the remaining position sections (RB, WR, TE) with the modern aesthetic.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was deep into refining the Trend Tool user interface. The user requested several specific enhancements after the previous exact UI replication was achieved. The current focus is on making the Trend Tool more modern and aesthetic, with better game separation and the ability to collapse certain columns.

The engineer has already started implementing these changes in . This involves:
1.  **Fixing game matchup display**: Ensuring actual game results are shown instead of TBD for selected weeks (e.g., Week 1-3 2025 for Giants).
2.  **Space-saving layout**: Implementing a design where passing stats are placed directly above receiving stats headers for positions like QB, to save horizontal space.
3.  **Clear position sections**: Adding visual breaks and distinct sections for Quarterbacks, Running Backs, Wide Receivers, and Tight Ends.
4.  **Modern aesthetic improvements**: General UI refinements focusing on small details to achieve a sleek, condensed data app feel.
5.  **Adding state for collapsible columns**: Preparing the functionality to allow users to collapse certain statistical columns within the Trend Tool.

The trajectory ends with the engineer in the middle of updating the table body () to apply the modern aesthetic and initial position sections, specifically working on adding the remaining position sections (RB, WR, TE). The  file is currently undergoing a significant rewrite to accommodate these new UI requirements.
