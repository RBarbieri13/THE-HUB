The AI engineer successfully transformed an NFL fantasy football application from an initial MVP to a professionally structured platform. The journey involved resolving critical data display bugs (snap counts, DraftKings pricing), implementing robust player name reconciliation, and undergoing extensive UI/UX overhauls. Key milestones included adopting a dynamic PPR scoring system, integrating a resizable player detail panel, and completely redesigning the layout to a tab-based interface with a collapsible top filter. Challenges like a broken third-party API for DraftKings pricing were encountered and partially addressed through research. The engineer demonstrated iterative development, debugging, and continuous adaptation to evolving user requirements, culminating in a highly functional and aesthetically pleasing application.

The initial goal was a dense AG-grid fantasy football database for NFL player statistics and trends, supporting 2024/2025 data, DraftKings PPR scoring, and manual data refresh for QB, RB, WR, TE positions. UI specified column headers, reduced padding, auto-resized columns, and row shading. Subsequent critical requests involved removing a top menu bar, displaying snap counts as nominal numbers (not percentages), and DraftKings pricing as numerical salaries. Later, the user requested color-coded statistics, PPR/Half-PPR toggles, a right-sliding player detail panel (last 10 games, resizable), removal of filter triangles/checkboxes, professional styling, a resizable left sidebar, logo replacement, clear 3-letter column abbreviations, and enhanced DraftKings pricing display. Most recently, the app shifted to a tabbed layout, a top collapsible filter section, and a clean, grid-based data table with specific formatting for game results and refined data visibility. DraftKings pricing for 2024 should not be shown, only 2025.

-   ****
    -   **Summary**: The core FastAPI backend handling data ingestion, processing, and API endpoints (, , etc.). It connects to DuckDB, processes  data (using Polars), and manages external API calls for DraftKings pricing.
    -   **Changes**: Initially configured, then updated to handle Polars DataFrames, install , create  column, implement  and  logic. Significant changes were made to SQL queries for data insertion, filtering, and joining, especially to fix snap count display (from percentages to nominal values) and implementing robust player name reconciliation using name-based matching.
-   ****
    -   **Summary**: The main React application component. Manages the UI, including the AG Grid, filter dropdowns, control buttons, and various interactive elements. It fetches data from the FastAPI backend and manages local UI state.
    -   **Changes**: Extensive modifications were made. Initially, it displayed basic player stats. Key updates include integrating AG Grid modules, correcting  values, defining AG Grid column headers, implementing sorting, and integrating new backend API calls. Major UI/UX changes involved removing the top menu bar, implementing a dynamic PPR scoring toggle, creating a right-sliding player detail panel, removing checkboxes and filter triangles, adopting a resizable left sidebar, changing the application logo, and significantly refactoring the entire layout to a tab-based design with a top-collapsible filter section and grouped column headers to match specific design requirements. Enhanced UX features like search, active filter indicators, and favorites were also added. It now handles auto-applying filters and fixed a bug with  in filters.
-   ****
    -   **Summary**: Contains styling primarily using Tailwind CSS. Controls the aesthetic and layout of the frontend, including padding, row heights, alternating row colors, and visual appearance of column headers.
    -   **Changes**: Modified for a more compact layout, reduced padding, fixed row heights, alternating row shading (later removed/simplified), and initial color-coding for AG Grid column headers. Subsequent updates focused on professional textures, enhanced header visibility (bold text, text shadows), and streamlining for readability, including removing position-based coloring and simplifying grouped header styling.
-   ****
    -   **Summary**: Lists Python package dependencies for the backend.
    -   **Changes**: Updated to include , , , , and  to support data processing and API integrations.
-   ****
    -   **Summary**: Lists Node.js package dependencies for the frontend.
    -   **Changes**: Updated to include AG Grid specific packages ( etc.) and other UI/UX related libraries like  and .

-   Implement the FantasyNerds API as an alternative for DraftKings pricing data, as the currently integrated RapidAPI solution is broken.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has just completed a major overhaul of the application's UI and data loading mechanism. The frontend now features a tab-based design with Data Table and Analytics tabs. The previous left-hand menu has been replaced by a top-collapsible filter section that matches a user-provided image, featuring a horizontal layout of filter dropdowns. The data table has been restructured to be grid-based with grouped column headers (e.g., passing stats in blue, rushing in green, receiving in purple), minimal padding, and enhanced data readability, including clear 3-letter abbreviations for stats. The application also includes a search bar, active filter indicators, favorite player functionality (heart icon), and a resizable player detail panel that slides from the right. A critical data loading issue, where the  filter parameter was causing backend errors, has been resolved, and filters now apply automatically without requiring a separate Apply Filters button. All core functionality, including accurate snap counts and fantasy point calculations (with PPR/Half-PPR toggle), is operational. However, the DraftKings pricing column still shows no data (DK $), as the external RapidAPI integration remains non-functional, and the user has specified to only show 2025 data when fixed.
